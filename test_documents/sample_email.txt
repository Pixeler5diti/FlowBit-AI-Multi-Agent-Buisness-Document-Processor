Subject: URGENT - System Outage Issue
Date: Thu, 6 Jun 2025 10:30:00 GMT

Dear Support Team,

We are experiencing a critical system outage that is affecting our entire production environment. This is extremely urgent and needs immediate attention.

Our main application servers went down at 9:45 AM and we're losing significant revenue every minute this continues. The error logs show database connection failures and the load balancer is reporting all backend services as unavailable.

I need someone from your team to contact me immediately at (555) 123-4567. This is a P1 incident and according to our SLA, we should have had a response within 15 minutes.

Please escalate this to your senior technical team right away. We cannot afford any more downtime.

Best regards,
John Smith
Senior DevOps Engineer
